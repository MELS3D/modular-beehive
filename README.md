# 🐝 modular-beehive
A modular 3D-printed beehive system designed for sustainable beekeeping, local manufacturing, and bee-first hive management.
### by **Mels 3D Labs**


This project reimagines the traditional beehive as a **scalable, repairable system** that grows with the colony instead of working against it.

## 🌍 Project Vision

Most conventional beehives are:
- static and hard to modify  
- difficult to repair  
- disruptive to bees during inspections  
- dependent on large, expensive fabrication tools  

The **Modular Beehive Platform** follows a different philosophy:

> *Expand only when needed. Replace only what fails. Print anywhere.*
> 
Langstroth logic meets modern modular engineering.

The goal is to eliminate barriers—technical, financial, and biological—while keeping bees at the center of the design.

## 🧩 Modular Architecture

The hive is composed of independent, stackable modules:

### Core Modules
- **Base Module**  
  Elevated foundation with controlled entrance, airflow, and moisture management.

- **Vertical Hive Body Modules**  
  Stackable sections for brood and honey storage.

- **Internal Comb / Insert Modules**  
  Removable vertical inserts that guide comb formation and allow inspection without destroying structure.

- **Structural Lock Rings**  
  Maintain alignment, rigidity, spacing, and airflow between sections.

- **Top System**  
  Segmented lid with internal space for insulation, feeding, or future sensor integration.

Each module is:
- independently printable  
- replaceable without dismantling the entire hive  
- designed for dimensional accuracy and repeatability
- Stackable body sections

## 🖨️ Designed for 3D Printing (Maker-First)

### Print Bed Compatibility
✅ **Fully compatible with standard 256 × 256 × 256 mm print beds**  
(Bambu Lab, Prusa XL segments, Creality, Elegoo, Anycubic, etc.)

This design **eliminates the need for large-format or industrial 3D printers**.  
Every component is sized to be printed on common consumer-grade machines.

### Supports
🚫 **No support material required**

- All parts are designed with self-supporting geometry  
- Reduced print time  
- Lower material waste  
- Cleaner internal surfaces for bees  

### Recommended Materials
- **PLA** – suitable for shaded or moderate climates  
- **PETG** – recommended for outdoor, high-temperature, or high-humidity environments  

### Print Philosophy
- minimal setup complexity  
- no exotic hardware  
- optimized wall thickness for strength + insulation  
- repair individual parts instead of replacing the whole hive  

This is a **print-first, support-free, accessible design**.

## 🐝 Bee-First Design Principles

- Vertical expansion aligned with natural colony growth  
- Smooth airflow paths to reduce condensation  
- Reduced vibration during inspections  
- No sharp internal edges  
- Modular access minimizes colony disturbance  

Healthy bees are productive bees.
