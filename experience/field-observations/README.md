# 🐝 Field Observations 
This folder documents **direct observations of bee behavior** that inform design decisions in the modular beehive system. These observations focus on **movement, clustering, comb usage, and colony interaction with structure**, rather than hardware design.

## Observed Species & Contexts

### Apis cerana
